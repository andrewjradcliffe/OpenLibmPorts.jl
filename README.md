# OpenLibmPorts

## Installation
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("OpenLibmPorts")
```

## Description
As the name says, ports from openlibm (https://github.com/JuliaMath/openlibm). This effort was borne of the need for pure Julia implementations of various special functions for use in automatic differentation. Expect low coverage as I create ports only as need dictates.
