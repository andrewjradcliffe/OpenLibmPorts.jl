## OpenLibmPorts

OpenLibmPorts contains pure Julia implementations of code contained in
OpenLibm, which itself contains code covered by various licenses
(https://github.com/JuliaMath/openlibm/blob/master/LICENSE.md). As the
code contained herein is expected to draw upon preexisting code
involving 1 or more licenses, the relevant license(s) for each source
file shall be reproduced at the top of said file; this confers the
greatest clarity with respect to copyright.

At the time of writing (2022-10-27), this repository contains code
adapted from OpenLibm which is itself adapted from FDLIBM. If/when
code involving a new license is added, this list will be updated.

## Acknowledgement and disclaimer

In general, this package will contain direct ports of the
corresponding code from openlibm
(https://github.com/JuliaMath/openlibm). I have copied the comments
and structure so as to faithfully maintain the correspondence. I make
no claims of innovation or technical contribution; credit goes to
the OpenLibm project and the copyright holders cited therein.

Any differences present between the source (OpenLibm) occur due
language differences (C vs. Julia). Minor modifications which yield
alternative versions (e.g. throw instead of return positive/negative
sign) are not considered to be an innovation -- simply a convenience
which may enhance performance, useful only to users that do not
require the information implied by the positive/negative sign.

If a source code file contains code which is not based on another
implementation, i.e. new contributions not pertaining to code which
already has an existing license, it shall be assumed to be MIT License.
At the time of initial conception, the author intends this statement to
refer to code of the following types: package interface, tests and benchmarking.
For code which falls in this category, the relevant license:
