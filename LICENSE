## OpenLibmPorts

OpenLibmPorts contains pure Julia implementations of code contained in
OpenLibm, which itself contains code covered by various licenses
(https://github.com/JuliaMath/openlibm/blob/master/LICENSE.md). As the
code contained herein is expected to draw upon preexisting code
involving 1 or more licenses, the relevant license(s) for each source
file shall be reproduced at the top of said file; this confers the
greatest clarity with respect to copyright.

Acknowledgement and disclaimer: in general, this package will contain
direct port of the corresponding code from openlibm
(https://github.com/JuliaMath/openlibm). I have copied the comments
and structure so as to faithfully maintain the correspondence. I make
no claim to any innovation or technical contribution; credit goes to
the OpenLibm project and the copyright holders cited therein.

If a source code file contains code which is not based on another
implementation, i.e. new contributions not pertaining to code which
already has an existing license, it shall be assumed to be MIT License.
At the time of initial conception, the author intends this statement to
refer to code of the following types: package interface and tests.
For code which falls in this category, the relevant license:
